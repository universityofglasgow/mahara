Mahara 16.04.0 Release Notes

This is a stable release of Mahara 16.04. Stable releases are fit for
general use. If you find a bug, please report it to the tracker:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/mahara/+filebug

This release includes an upgrade path from 1.7.0. If you wish to
upgrade, we encourage you to make a copy of your website and test the
upgrade on it first, to minimise the effect of any potential
unforeseen problems.

Changes from the 15.10 series:

New features:
 * OpenBadge Displayer block
 * Embed.ly support in the External Media block
 * Internal Media block now uses HTML5 instead of Flash
 * MathSlate plugin available in the TinyMCE visual editor
 * Additional settings in IMAP auth plugin for better compatibility with Google Apps
 * Wall posts now send notifications to the owner of the wall
 * Password to limit HTTP access to cron and upgrade scripts
 * Ajaxified tag selection
 * Watchlist block is paginated
 * Size of "My pages" block can be customized
 
Deprecated features:
 * The Persona (aka BrowserID) authentication plugin is deprecated, because Mozilla will be 
   ending the Persona service in November 2016. The plugin is still included in Mahara 16.04,
   but it is disabled by default. If you have an existing Mahara site that uses Persona for
   authentication, watch Bug 1533377 on Launchpad for updates on Mahara's migration away from
   Persona: https://bugs.launchpad.net/mahara/+bug/1533377
